# SaveFromNet - YouTube Style Fix

This is a small Chrome extension that fixes the SaveFrom.net extension's stylesheets on YouTube pages to blend more harmoniously with YouTube's design.

> #### *Context*
> *SaveFrom.net extension adds a new download button under YouTube videos and shorts but it lacks cohesiveness with the YouTube design, and sometimes even breaks the page structure, which this repository fixes.*
